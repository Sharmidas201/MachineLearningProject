## Overview

This code is a Python script designed for data preprocessing and classification using the Random Forest algorithm. It is intended for a supervised machine learning task where you have labeled data to train and evaluate a predictive model. The code includes steps for handling missing data, encoding categorical features, scaling numeric features, training a Random Forest classifier, and making predictions.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

### 1. Data Preparation

- Ensuring we have the training data in a file named "risk-train.txt" with columns relevant to our classification task.

### 2. Libraries and Dependencies

Making sure we have the necessary libraries installed. You can use the following commands to install them.


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib


### 3. Running the Script

Execute the script by running the Python code provided. You can use an integrated development environment (IDE) or run it from the command line using:

python your_script.py

### 4. Data Preprocessing

The script will perform the following data preprocessing steps:

- Load the training data from "risk-train.txt."
- Handle missing values using forward filling.
- Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables (customize as needed).
- Process the "TIME_ORDER" column by converting it to minutes past midnight.
- Apply label encoding to specified columns.
- Calculate the age from the "B_BIRTHDATE" column and create a new "AGE" column.
- Replace '?' with 0 in specific columns.

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation

- Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).
- Split the data into training and validation sets.
- Scale the features using StandardScaler.
- Train a Random Forest classifier with the specified number of estimators.
- Make predictions on the validation set.
- Evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix and a classification report.

### 6. Model Saving

- The trained Random Forest model will be saved to a file named "risk.pkl" using the joblib library.

### 7. Making Predictions on Test Data

- Preparing our test data in a file named "risk-test.txt" with similar columns as the training data.
- Execute the script to load and preprocess the test data.
- Impute missing values and transform the data for prediction.
- Use the pre-trained model to make predictions on the test data.

### 8. Saving Predictions

- The predictions, along with corresponding order IDs, will be saved to a file named "classification_results.txt."
