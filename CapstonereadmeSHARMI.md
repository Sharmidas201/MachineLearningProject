\f1\b0 \
\
## Overview\
\
This code is a Python script designed for data preprocessing and classification using the Random Forest algorithm. It is intended for a supervised machine learning task where you have labeled data to train and evaluate a predictive model. The code includes steps for handling missing data, encoding categorical features, scaling numeric features, training a Random Forest classifier, and making predictions.\
\
## Usage\
\
To use this code, follow these steps:\
\
### 1. Data Preparation\
\
- Ensuring we have the training data in a file named "risk-train.txt" with columns relevant to our classification task.\
\
### 2. Libraries and Dependencies\
\
Making sure we have the necessary libraries installed. You can use the following commands to install them:\
\
```bash\
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib\
```\
\
### 3. Running the Script\
\
Execute the script by running the Python code provided. You can use an integrated development environment (IDE) or run it from the command line using:\
\
```bash\
python your_script.py\
```\
\
### 4. Data Preprocessing\
\
The script will perform the following data preprocessing steps:\
\
- Load the training data from "risk-train.txt."\
- Handle missing values using forward filling.\
- Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables (customize as needed).\
- Process the "TIME_ORDER" column by converting it to minutes past midnight.\
- Apply label encoding to specified columns.\
- Calculate the age from the "B_BIRTHDATE" column and create a new "AGE" column.\
- Replace '?' with 0 in specific columns.\
\
### 5. Model Training and Evaluation\
\
- Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).\
- Split the data into training and validation sets.\
- Scale the features using StandardScaler.\
- Train a Random Forest classifier with the specified number of estimators.\
- Make predictions on the validation set.\
- Evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix and a classification report.\
\
### 6. Model Saving\
\
- The trained Random Forest model will be saved to a file named "risk.pkl" using the joblib library.\
\
### 7. Making Predictions on Test Data\
\
- Preparing our test data in a file named "risk-test.txt" with similar columns as the training data.\
- Execute the script to load and preprocess the test data.\
- Impute missing values and transform the data for prediction.\
- Use the pre-trained model to make predictions on the test data.\
\
### 8. Saving Predictions\
\
- The predictions, along with corresponding order IDs, will be saved to a file named "classification_results.txt."\
